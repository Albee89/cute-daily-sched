This project was originally ootstrapped from Codewithfaraz with original JS and some design adjustments by me :)
This project is a Vanilla JS Activity Dashboard which tracks activity/sports/fitness, perhaps connected to a smart device, 
and with options to receive updates from, and share updates with, friends. Currently still in development, including components (Home, Profile, Activities, Settings)
